# Mobile App Development

## Overview

Building a companion mobile app for our platform. Targeting both iOS and Android.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Backend**: REST API (see [[api-redesign]])
- **Auth**: OAuth 2.0

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to access my dashboard on mobile
2. As a user, I want to receive push notifications
3. As a user, I want to sync data across devices

## Blockers

- Waiting on [[api-redesign]] to be completed
- Need design system from [[website-redesign-project]]

## Notes

![[mobile-app-mockup.png]]

This project depends heavily on the backend API work. We should coordinate with the backend team to ensure endpoints are ready before we start development.
